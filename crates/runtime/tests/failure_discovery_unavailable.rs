//! Failure injection: discovery unavailable to a connecting guest.
//!
//! A guest whose discovery rendezvous cannot be made must fail or park within
//! a bounded time; it must not spin or hang the runtime. The probe is
//! bootstrapped with a zero `Context` handle and no discovery service running,
//! which is exactly what a client sees when the registry is down.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d by default because it needs the discovery-probe guest built for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
