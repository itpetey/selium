//! Crash-consistency lane: a durable component stopped mid-write must replay
//! to a consistent state on restart.
//!
//! The store's on-disk contract is a framed record log: each record carries a
//! length and a CRC32, and a reader replays frames until the first frame that
//! is incomplete or fails its checksum (`selium_store::format::scan_frames`).
//! That is the whole crash story for the durable surfaces that sit on it — the
//! store, the identity guest's registries and logs, and the control plane's
//! recorded deployments all publish through these framed volumes — so the test
//! cuts the write at **every byte offset** of a real volume and asserts that
//! the replayed prefix is exactly the records that were complete, never a
//! partial or corrupted one.
//!
//! "Restart" is a close and a fresh open of the volume: the kernel's volume
//! layer holds no in-memory truth, so the bytes on disk are what replay sees.
//! The tear is produced by appending only a prefix to a fresh segment, which
//! is the state a crash between two writes leaves behind.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d: the design places crash-consistency in the scheduled lane
//! rather than every push (`scripts/gate.sh --soak` runs it nightly). Unlike
//! the soak, the lane needs no wasm guests or network, so it is cheap.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p selium-runtime --test crash_consistency -- --ignored
//! ```
