//! Cross-guest wake delivery integration tests (`cross-guest-wake-delivery`).
//!
//! A guest task parked on a shared channel must be woken by a write from
//! *another* guest process. The wake travels host-side: the writer's
//! generation advance reaches the runtime, which delivers a mailbox wake to
//! every process that registered interest in the region via `WaitRegister`.
//!
//! The consumer here is never polled by the test. Draining the guest's log
//! channel reads shared memory directly and does not re-enter the guest's
//! WASM, so the only thing that can produce the `woke` log line is a wake
//! delivered by the runtime.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d by default because they require the wake-probe guest built
//! for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p selium-wake-probe
//! cargo test -p selium-runtime --test cross_guest_wake -- --ignored
//! ```
