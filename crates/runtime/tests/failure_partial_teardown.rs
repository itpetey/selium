//! Failure injection: a revocation publish fails mid-teardown.
//!
//! `stop_process` must report the failure, retain the process authority, and
//! leave the revocations staged so a retry completes them. The runtime seam
//! (`Runtime::inject_discovery_publish_failure`) fails the feed publish; the
//! retry then runs against the real discovery feed.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d by default because it needs the discovery and discovery-probe
//! guests built for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
