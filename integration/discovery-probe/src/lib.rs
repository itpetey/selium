//! Discovery probe test fixture guest.
//!
//! Minimal application guest used by the discovery and failure-injection
//! integration tests. Receives its bootstrap discovery `Context` (built by the
//! entrypoint macro, exercising the discovery rendezvous), allocates a
//! shared-memory region, logs its progress, and marks ready.
//!
//! Roles are selected by the trailing integer entrypoint argument:
//!
//! - [`ROLE_PROVIDER`] registers a route in the discovery registry through the
//!   SDK (which also renews its lease) and stays resident.
//! - [`ROLE_CONSUMER`] watches a route through [`selium_guest::Context::watch`]
//!   and logs every event it observes.
//! - [`ROLE_RESOLVER`] resolves a URI once and logs `found` or `notfound`.
//! - [`ROLE_REGISTER_NO_RENEW`] registers through the raw discovery client and
//!   deliberately never renews, so the lease sweep must expire it.
//! - [`ROLE_TRAP_AFTER_REGISTER`] registers and then crashes, so the runtime's
//!   failure path (not the graceful stop path) has to revoke the route.
//! - [`ROLE_FORGE`] tries to register a reserved root route without holding
//!   its claim; discovery must refuse it.
//! - [`ROLE_CLAIM_ROUTE`] registers a reserved handler route under a
//!   host-provisioned claim and stays resident, so a second claimant can be
//!   refused with a conflict.
