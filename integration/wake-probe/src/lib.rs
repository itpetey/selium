//! Cross-guest wake probe fixture guest.
//!
//! Used by the `selium-runtime` `cross_guest_wake` integration test to verify
//! how a parked guest task behaves: that a *write from another guest process*
//! wakes it, that polling it costs it nothing, and that a yield-only pass does
//! not re-enter it.
//!
//! Four roles, selected by the integer entrypoint argument:
//!
//! - [`MODE_PUBLISHER`] creates a channel, announces its region id, then
//!   publishes one frame per interval forever (staying resident so its writer
//!   registration keeps `writer_count` above zero — a reader sees EOF, not a
//!   park, once the last writer withdraws).
//! - [`MODE_PARKER`] creates a channel and parks on it without ever
//!   publishing, so an attached watcher has nothing that will ever wake it.
//! - [`MODE_WATCHER`] attaches to an announced region id and parks on a read.
//!   Its reader starts at the live tail, so it can only be woken by a frame
//!   published *after* it attached. It logs once a frame arrives, so the log
//!   line is proof that the wake landed.
//! - [`MODE_YIELDER`] yields forever and counts its yields, so the test can
//!   measure how much of the guest's execution a host poll drives.
