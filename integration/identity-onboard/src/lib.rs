//! Operator test guest for the identity golden-path and power-cycle tests.
//!
//! Drives the platform's operator surfaces exactly as a control guest will:
//! resolves `sel:///identity`, onboards the `acme` tenant's CA, issues user
//! leaves from a test-supplied client SPKI, records that principal's baseline
//! grants, and writes issued leaves back to a blob store where the host-side
//! test reads them; and drives the control plane's `sel:///control` surface to
//! upload a module and record a deployment, then read it back.
//!
//! The test supplies the client SPKI as a pointer entrypoint argument and the
//! mode as an integer entrypoint argument, so later invocations of the same
//! guest drive the other legs (revocation, a post-restart issue, a post-restart
//! deployment check) against state the first lifetime left behind.
