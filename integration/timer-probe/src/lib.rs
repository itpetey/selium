//! Timer probe test fixture guest.
//!
//! Used by the `selium-runtime` `timer` integration test to verify that a
//! real `wasm32` guest awaiting [`selium_guest::Timer`] (the `Sleep` hostcall)
//! is resumed at its deadline when nothing else happens in the platform: the
//! runtime's timer driver owns the deadline and delivers the wake through the
//! mailbox, so the guest is never re-entered by an external poll.
//!
//! The entrypoint *is* the poll owner, so a successful run proves the wake
//! landed: the process only exits once the timer fires and the entrypoint
//! returns.
