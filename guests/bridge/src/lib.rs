//! Single-instance (per-platform) bridge server system guest.
//!
//! The QUIC connector terminates QUIC and delivers each accepted stream to the
//! single bridge server as a per-stream handoff whose [`IncomingConnection`]
//! metadata carries the authenticated client identity (`tenant` +
//! fingerprint). The bridge server:
//!
//! - creates its own listener and registers its root serving route
//!   (`sel:///bridge`, wire name `bridge`) with discovery via `Context::serve`,
//!   deriving the route from that one declaration;
//! - derives each handoff's tenant from the decoded identity — the single
//!   bridge-server is bound to no one tenant, so it never refuses an identity
//!   on cross-tenant grounds;
//! - resolves the handoff's identity to a grant set from the identity guest's
//!   published grant table (a `fingerprint -> baseline grants` live table read
//!   via [`GrantTable`]), replacing the interim `IdentityGrantMap` stub;
//! - spawns one `bridge-channel <shared_id, grants>` per stream, conferring the
//!   client's grants (narrowed for that identity's tenant) plus an
//!   `ExplicitResource` for the handed-off region via the `DelegateGrants`
//!   capability held at `Namespace::Root`;
//! - refuses unknown identities by attaching then closing the delivered region
//!   so the connector observes EOF and FINs the client stream;
//! - delegates the spawn bound to the host-enforced per-tenant process quota:
//!   a `Process::start_for_tenant` failure (e.g. the tenant's quota is
//!   exhausted) is surfaced by attach-then-close, with no guest-local spawn
//!   counter.
//!
//! The bridge server terminates no QUIC and relays no stream bytes; it is a
//! control-plane guest only.
